TO-DO
- [ ] deploy the app on heroku

As a cinephile and a person who treasures feelings about fragments of life, I'd like to implement a simple but really handy website to record some information.  

1. In the "Movie" module, you can record a film by its release year and title,  then the film's poster and imdb link offered, allowing you to examine more specific infomation.  You can click "My films" to pick up some films to watch.
2. In the "Input" module, you can input some text, which could be something to do, some feelings about life, or even some sentences inspiring. Then click "Diary" to check the text you input as a form of timeline.
